The division of Europe into a number of independent states, connected, however, with each other, by the general resemblance of religion, language, and manners, is productive of the most beneficial consequences to the liberty of mankind. A modern tyrant, who should find no resistance either in his own breast, or in his people, would soon experience a gentle restraint from the example of his equals, the dread of present censure, the advice of his allies, and the apprehension of his enemies. The object of his displeasure, escaping from the narrow limits of his dominions, would easily obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune adequate to his merit, the freedom of complaints, and perhaps the means of revenge. But the empire of the Romans filled the world, and when that empire fell into the hands of a single person, the world became a safe and dreary prison for his enemies. The slave of Imperial despotism, whether he was condemned to drag his gilded chain in Rome and the senate, or to wear out a life or exile on the barren rock of Seriphus, or the frozen banks of the Danube, expected his fate in silent despair. To resist was fatal, and it was impossible to fly. On every side he was encompassed with a vast extent of sea and land, which he could never hope to traverse without being discovered, seized, and restored to his irritated master. Beyond the frontiers, his anxious view could discover nothing, except the ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of barbarians, of fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent kings, who would gladly purchase the emperor's protection by the sacrifice of an obnoxious fugitive. “Wherever you are,” said Cicero to the exiled Marcellus, “remember that you are equally within the power of the conqueror.”

Sooner or later all lakes undergo an aging process and eventually disappear entirely. This procedure may take ten thousand years and is knwon as eutorophication. In this process a lake, originally crystal clear, becomes a swampy-smelling body of water full of plant growth called algae. The main requirements for this plant growth, in addition to carbon dioxide and water, are nitrate and phosphate. These minerals are usually called limiting nutrients because the plant growth is determined by the amount of these minerals in the water. Waste matter added to fresh water by people is often rich in phosphate. This is especially true of detergents, and the phosphates encourage the growth of algae. The net result is that the water of eutrophied lakes becomes distasteful and unhealthy. Eutrophied lakes can no longer support fish, and they become useless for recreation. The most famous example is Lake Erie, which is said to have aged ten thousand years in the past few decades.
chapter3
The Ptolemaic system is essentially a mathematical system invented to explain the organization of the universe. The cosmos in this view was a group of concetric spheres with a common center, the earth. The earth alone was made up of hard, solid substance; the other spheres encircling the earth were all crystalline spheres, transparent spheres containing in each a luminous heavenly body which moved around the earth in its transparent sphere. The sphere nearest to the earth was that of the moon, followed by those of Mercury, Venus, the sun, and the other planets. The outermost sphere contained all of the fixed stars that remined motionless in respect to each other, as the sphere itself moved majestically about the earth in its daily motion.
However, with the increasingly detailed knowledge of the actual movement of the heavenly bodies, the astronomers had to make the Ptolemaic system more and more intricate with the introduction of new cycles and epicycles. Copernicus treated the Ptolemaic system as a mathematical problem. He was able to prove mathematically that a sun-centered theory was simpler than the geocentric theory. Building on the findings of Copernicus, Kepler found mathematical laws describing the movement of the planets. The Copernican doctrine, however, long remained a hypothesis known only to experts. Most astronomers could find little evidence to accept it in preference to the older theory. Only with the continued discoveries and advances in mathematics was the worth of the Copernican theory demonstrated.
chapter4
It was not a governing class that America needed―that ideal cherished by the Federalists and revived by the civil service reformers―but a people intelligent enough to use government to prosper the comonwealth, realistic enough to recognize the economic bases of politics, moderate enough to exercise self-restraint, bold enough to countenance experiments, mature enough to distinguish between statesmanship and demagoguery, farsighted enough to plan for their children and their children's children. All this was, to be sure, a large order, and only perfectionists could be disappointed that it was not filled. Yet if Americans remained politically immature, they revealed as great a competence in the art and science of politics as any other people, and rather more than most. They were reluctant to modernize their machinery of government; yet through it needed constant care, it never wholly broke down as it often did in the Old World. They tolerated corruption, yet their political standards were as high as their business standards, and the contrast between the conduct of the Civil War and the Second World War suggests some progress in political morality. They frightened themselves with bogies of bureaucracy, regimentation, and dictatorship, but in fact remained singularly free from bureaucracy in the Old World sense, avoided political regimentation, and never knew the meaning of dictatorship as so many people in Europe, Latin America, and the East knew it.

How Facebook changed our lives

In just a decade, the social media juggernaut has transformed the way we interact.


SAN FRANCISCO — The calendar may say 2014, but in tech culture this week actually marks the year 10 A. F — After Facebook.

What did we poor humans do before the advent of Mark Zuckerberg’s collegiate brainstorm? Let’s see, we smiled when we “liked” something, we dialed the phone to “update” friends and “tagging” was a kids’ game.

The upside of those innocent pre-social media times: intimacy. The downside: intimacy. If you wanted to reach a huge group, it meant sending an e-mail with a cc list that looked like the phone book.

Then came teenage Zuck and his shrewdly rolled-out vision for a new kind of digital club where you played bouncer, all with a Machiavellian backstory that eventually merited its own Oscar-winning movie, The Social Network. Facebook haters crowed after its hyped IPO last May quickly went sour, but the company has bounced back with a fiscal vengeance.

By the end of 2013, its turbo-charged stock had made founder Zuckerberg, 29, a $31 billion man thanks to $7.9 billion in annual revenue, a 55% jump over 2012. Fueling such growth was rapid mobile adoption, which last quarter accounted for 53% of all advertising and paves the way for a bullish new year.

STORY: The sad fate of Facebook’s rivals

At the heart of this business boom is a service that over the past decade has revolutionized and expanded — for better or for worse — the way humans interact. A million of us liked the site in 2004, then 250 million five years later. Today, Facebook has 1.2 billion users. Even if the site were to disappear or wildly reinvent itself in the next decade, our habits are forever altered.

“The biggest impact of Facebook was that it broke us out of e-mail jail,” says Paul Saffo, a longtime Silicon Valley futurist. “E-mail implied you had to reply, Facebook did not. E-mail is formal, Facebook is a salutation. E-mail you send, Facebook you broadcast. It’s simply a new social medium for which we’re still learning the social norms.”

While Facebook has spawned plenty of unappealing habits — oversharing perhaps topping that list — its genius was in creating a platform that allowed people to connect over long distances and reconnect over lost years. It tapped into a yearning that grew with the geographic scattering of the nation’s workforce.

Your childhood neighborhood may be but a memory, but it could gather once again on Facebook.

“In the recent past, if you left people physically for a job or marriage, you simply moved on, but Facebook made maintaining those relationship easy,” says Danah Boyd of Microsoft Research and author of the forthcoming book, It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens.

“The important takeaway from Facebook’s rise is that people have a desire to connect broadly,” she says. “For the longest time, technology limited communication to one on one; just think of the telephone. But now our worlds are complicated networks that overlap. The implications of that have yet to be fully realized.”

STAYING CONNECTED

That may well be, but most of today’s Facebook users aren’t too concerned with the sociological ramifications of a shift in human communication. They’re just glad they can keep grandma or little Billy posted on what’s new.

“I lived in California and my grandmother lived in upper Michigan, and I had felt really badly about losing touch until she got a laptop and signed up for Facebook,” says Kristy Campbell, 46, a communications director at Juniper Networks.

“Our world opened up to her. She attended my daughter’s graduation and prom via Facebook, and when she suddenly passed away. I was left with a digital record of our interactions that I will never take down,” says Campbell, who also used the site to create a network of divorcees that helped each other through that life change. “I really don’t remember life before Facebook.”

For every Facebook user who may have gotten tired of maintaining their page and quit, countless testimonials speak to the network’s transformative effect.

Ann Friedlander, 65, of West Palm Beach, Fla. , has children in Hong Kong, Connecticut and California. Without Facebook, she says, “I’d never know what they’re up to or see photos of my grandchildren.”

She also used the site to get back in touch with childhood friends in New Jersey and, more poignantly “discovered, through Facebook, that a neighbor died on 9/11 trying to rescue someone.”

In remote Morro Bay midway down the California coast, Kelly Lipton, 64, uses Facebook to ease her sense of isolation, which is amplified by hearing issues. “I find Facebook is a good way to keep up,” she says. “I love it so much I can’t believe it.”

And while much has been made of late about how younger generations are fast migrating away from Facebook to newer social networking sites and apps, Bella Maestas, 15, of Hillsborough, Calif. , loves the way Facebook helps her tackle homework with classmates and stay connected socially.

“In a way, it takes the place of the diary,” she says. “It also leaves a mark of you on the world. Everyone wants to be known, noticed and remembered.”

MISSIONARY ZEAL

Whether Zuckerberg knew he was tapping into something as universal as a need to reach out and be remembered is unknown. But, by all accounts, a missionary’s zeal permeated the initially small Silicon Valley offices of Facebook as the company built momentum.

“It was pretty remarkable when I started (in late 2004), still a living room operation in Los Altos Hills,” says Ezra Callahan, 32, who joined the team just out of Stanford and was employee No. 6.

He left in 2010 and took “a year to recover. ” The all-in intensity was such that employees were encouraged to live as close to work as possible.

“You were given a $600-a-month stipend if you lived within a mile of the company, and half of us qualified,” he says. “It was intentional. We were a family. The value of having such a close culture was it made people want to stay and work harder.”

Peter Sealey, a former marketing director at Coca-Cola and Columbia Pictures, joined Facebook’s board of advisers a few years after its launch. “Even then,” he says, “you could immediately tell these people were working on something that would have a profound impact on society.”

Sealey says to him Facebook’s future was self-evident when he took into account technologist George Gilder’s law, which states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users.

“Today, the Catholic Church has 1.2 billion members, and so does Facebook, in just 10 years,” he says. “Humans have an ingrained need to have a tribe and to share among that tribe. Myspace could have won this battle, but Zuckerberg just built a more convenient and familiar service.”

Speaking of the Harvard dropout (he’s in good company: so was Bill Gates), it’s clear Zuckerberg doesn’t intend to rest on his laurels or his cash.

“We can do a better job” informing members about newly added features, Zuckerberg told USA TODAY at a company event in Menlo Park in December. “We have focus groups explaining what we intend to do, but we still catch a lot of people by surprise.”

Facebook’s willingness to be flexible with its approach when it has to be will be key to its future, says Bret Taylor, the company’s former chief technology officer who oversaw integration with Apple’s iOS software as well as the adoption of the famous Like button.

“Facebook could be very different in 10 years, but I see it being around, because it’s not afraid to change often,” he says, offering as example the company’s purchase of photo-sharing site Instagram for $1 billion last April.

“There are interesting parallels in Google buying YouTube and Facebook buying Instagram. I was at each company when that happened, and both were criticized for overpaying,” he says. “Both turned out to be good deals. It is hugely important in moving forward to show a willingness to be bold.”

WHAT LIES AHEAD?

As for the future, there was some buzz recently about a Princeton University study that said Facebook was akin to a viral outbreak that would mercifully abate, losing 80% of its peak user base in the next few years.

Facebook’s cheeky response was to offer a “report” by its data scientists predicting that “Princeton will have only half its current enrollment by 2018, and by 2021 it will have no students at all.”

Jibes and parries aside, Facebook’s next decade is likely to be more tumultuous than its culturally dominant first 10 years. A recent YPulse survey revealed that 65% of those under 18 thought Facebook was “losing its cool factor.”

But regardless of this cultural patriarch’s future, the best way to judge Facebook’s impact is the same way we ultimately assess the job of any parent – by their kids, which in social media terms include Twitter, SnapChat, WhatsApp and international successes such as Japan’s Line and China’s WeChat.

Facebook taught us that the Internet could be used to share our lives in a way and with a scope that was novel, and just as the dominant communication tool of the moment was growing ponderous.

“Remember when America Online started, and you’d hear that ping and the voice said ‘You’ve got mail,’? Well that soon had turned into, ‘Argh, I’ve got mail,’ ” says author Boyd with a laugh. “Then Facebook came along, and all of a sudden, ‘Oooo, there are all my friends!’

“There may be a lot of shiny new (social media) apps out there now, but Facebook’s impact was as extraordinarily important as AOL’s. AOL opened up people to the Internet. Facebook opened up people to each other.”

Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS  WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish  advertizing.
JAKE (V.O.)
They can fix a spinal, if you’ve got the

The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the  crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people  wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a  LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous,  isolated souls.

Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side,  pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the  other, and so on.
His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his  arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A “Born Loser”  tattoo prominent on his shoulder.

We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front  wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his  forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets,  CLAP and WHOOP.
Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer.
A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men  RUNNING on antelope legs.
CU JAKE, watching what he can’t have. Expression stony.
JAKE (V.O.)
Let’s get it straight up front. I don’t
want your pity. I know the world’s a
cold-ass bitch.
Jake’s eyes shift -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in  the crowd. A MAN on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he’s with.  Hard. She cowers but he’s got her arm, shouting, raising his  fist. An eternal tableau. People look away.
CU JAKE -- not looking away.

Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans  down and grabs one leg of the man’s barstool -- and YANKS.
The chair flips. The guy goes down HARD and --
JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy,  getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap  out of him, right there on the floor.

THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on  the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him,  banging across the alley, landing in the trash.
Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. He’s bleeding and  bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.
JAKE
I hope you realize you’ve just lost a
customer!
He collapses onto his back, panting.
JAKE

Candy ass bitch.
He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR  overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking --  then shouts jauntily to no one in particular --

CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled  amongst the trash, getting drenched.
TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him.

Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him. He  squints up at --
TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and  blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.

It’s about your brother.CUT TO: INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT
DOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER  FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN’S FACE. He  looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His  IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY.

The strong prey on the weak. A guy with
a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for
the paper in his wallet.
WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech  CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake  stares down at his own face.
JAKE
Jesus, Tommy.
JAKE (V.O.)
The Suits’ concern was touching.
AGENT 1
Your brother represented a significant
investment. We’d like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.
The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape  dispenser, like it’s a package for shipping. The cardboard  coffin is rolled into the furnace.
JAKE (V.O.)
The egghead and the jarhead. Tommy was
the scientist, not me. He was the one
who wanted to get shot light years out

EXT. SPACE
Against the cold infinity of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR  SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE STAR. As it moves past like an  endless train, we realize this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half  a mile long. PAN WITH IT 180 to REVEAL --
A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of  moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face.
The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a  blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The  ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.CUT TO:
EXT. PANDORA ORBIT
ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the  sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora.
CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive “VALKYRIE” SHUTTLES are mated to  a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and  moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts.
As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear  the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we-- CUT TO:

FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas  carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around  the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding.
The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are  waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.
Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to --
AN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the  terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story  buildings.
And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --

EXT. HELL’S GATE - TWILIGHT
HELL’S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel  structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high,  topped with razor wire.
At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS  swiveling on servo mounts.
Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in  across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle,  bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.

CREW CHIEF
Remember people, you lose your mask
you’re unconscious in 20 seconds and
you’re dead in four minutes. Let’s nobody
be dead today, it looks bad on my report.
The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark --
CREW CHIEF
Exopack on, let’s go!
BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter  radius as it settles onto its landing gear.
INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles  ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks --  and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the  level of everyone else’s WAISTS.

THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.
CREW CHIEF
Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
Go straight inside!
HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double  time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward  a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex.
Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS  TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops  is the colony’s private security force. These guys are laid  back, hardened, and haggard.
WAINFLEET
Look at all that new meat.
THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp.
FIKE
Check it out, man. Meals on wheels.
WAINFLEET
That is just wrong.
Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --
A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy  wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires --  ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the  advanced technology.
Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and  heavily armed, they are AT-99 “SCORPION” GUNSHIPS.
MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4  meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily  armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds  of feet high. A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS  light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off  the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.
WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball  as he approaches.
JAKE
What’re you two limpdicks starin’ at?
As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and --
 9.
K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his  head.
A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs  against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link  with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT.
WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL. It drops off  the fence, tail still lashing.
WAINFLEET
Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up
in one.
Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.
ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED  FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair  through the tunnel below.
The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long  parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen’s claws raked  across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem  hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.
The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky. He eyes  are an icy steel gray.
HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky,  beyond the clouds.

You are not in Kansas any more...CUT TO: INT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHT
THE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the  HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell’s Gate colony. A hundred new  arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the  front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide.
Without his mask, we see that Quaritch’s features are rugged  and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to  jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very  large PISTOL.
QUARITCH
... You are on Pandora, ladies and
gentlemen. Respect that fact every second
of every day.

JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back.
COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window,  toward the dark treeline.
QUARITCH

Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the  abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see  that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long  black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.
JAKE
Damn. They got big.
 12.
NORM
Yeah, they mature on the trip out.
(to Max)
So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty
well.
MAX
Yeah, they’ve got great muscle tone. Give
us a few hours, you guys can take them
for a spin.
THE FIGURE’S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features  are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout --  definitely JAKE’S.
JAKE
It looks like him.
NORM
No, it looks like you. This is your
avatar now, Jake.
ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank.
JAKE (V.O.)
The idea is -- every driver is matched to
his own avatar --
STEREOCAM VIDEO SHOT OF JAKE -- facing the camera, talking  directly to the lens. JAKE’S VOICE-OVER up until now has  been part of this VIDEOLOG.
JAKE
-- so their nervous systems are in tune.
Or something. Which is why they offered
me this gig, because I can link with
Tommy’s avatar, which was insanely
expensive.
(looking off camera)
Is this right? I just say whatever in
these videologs?
WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max.
NORM
Yeah. You just need to get in the habit
of documenting everything -- what you
see, what you feel -- it’s all part of
the science. Good science starts with
good observation.
 13.
JAKE
Right.(to camera)
So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.
(looks around)
Never been in a lab before.
MAX
Log off. It’s time to meet your boss for
the next five years.
He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the -- CUT TO:
INT. LINK ROOM - DUSK
The LINK ROOM contains a dozen PSIONIC LINK UNITS, which look  like coffins crossed with MRI scanners.
NORM
Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the
head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote
the book -- I mean literally wrote the
book -- on Pandoran botany.
MAX
(low, over his shoulder)
That's because she likes plants better
than people.
DR. GRACE AUGUSTINE sits up in her link, stretching and  cracking her neck after a long session. She’s fifty, with a  strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes.
GRACE
(yelling)
Who’s got my goddamn cigarette?!
A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit. Around here  they jump when Grace barks.
Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach.
MAX
And here she is, Cinderella back from the
ball. Grace, I’d like you to meet Norm
Spellman and Ja --
GRACE
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?
 14.
NORM
(Na'vi, subtitled)
May the All Mother smile upon our first
meeting.
Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette.
GRACE
(subtitled)
Not bad. You sound a little formal.
NORM
(subtitled)
There is still much to learn.
Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na’vi.
MAX
Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----
GRACE
(turning to Jake)
Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I
don’t need you. I need your brother.
(to Max)
You know -- the PhD who trained three
years for this mission.
JAKE
He’s dead. I know it’s a big
inconvenience to everyone.
GRACE
How much lab training have you had? Ever
run a gas chromatograph?

No.
JAKE GRACE

Any actual lab work at all?
JAKE
High school chemistry. But I ditched.
Grace wheels on Max.
GRACE
You see? You see? They’re pissing on us  without even the courtesy of calling it  rain.(turning away)
I’m going to Selfridge.
 15.
She shoves past Jake.
MAX
Grace, that’s not a good idea.
But she’s already out the door and clomping down the  corridor. Max turns to Jake with a pained look.
MAX
Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred. Try to
use big words.CUT TO: INT. OPS CENTER - DUSK
It looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of  screens and bay windows showing the whole complex.
ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly  opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge  is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless.
He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a  practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as  Grace strides toward him.
GRACE
Parker, I used to think it was benign
neglect, but now I see you’re
intentionally screwing us.
SELFRIDGE
Grace. You know I enjoy our little
talks.
GRACE
I need a research assistant, not some
jarhead dropout.
Selfridge looks down and hits the ball.
Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past.  Selfridge looks at her with a sigh.
SELFRIDGE
Actually, we got lucky with him.
GRACE
Lucky? How is this in any way lucky?
As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball --
 16.
SELFRIDGE
Well -- lucky your guy had a twin
brother, and lucky the brother wasn’t an
oral hygienist or something. A Marine we
can use. I’m assigning him to your team
as security escort.
GRACE
The last thing I need is another trigger
happy asshole out there!
SELFRIDGE
Look, you’re supposed to be winning the
hearts and minds of the natives. Isn’t
that the whole point of your little
puppet show? If you look like them, if
you talk like them, they’ll trust you?
Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby.  Grace follows.
SELFRIDGE
But after -- how many years? -- relations
with the indigenous are only getting
worse.
GRACE
That tends to happen when you use machine
guns on them.
On Selfridge’s desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK.  Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb  and forefinger, in front of Grace’s eyes.
SELFRIDGE
This is why we’re here. Unobtanium.
Because this little gray rock sells for
twenty million a kilo. No other reason.
This is what pays for the party. And
it’s what pays for your science.
Comprendo?
He places it back in the magnetic field.
SELFRIDGE
Those savages are threatening our whole
operation. We’re on the brink of war and
you’re supposed to be finding a
diplomatic solution. So use what you’ve
got and get me some results.CUT TO:
 17.
INT. LINK ROOM - DAY
NEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units.
Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining  chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE’S AVATAR lies on a gurney,  breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM’S AVATAR is on a  second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks.
Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric  sensors.
GRACE
How much link time have you logged?
NORM
Five hundred and twenty hours.
Grace looks pointedly at Jake.
JAKE
Like -- an hour.
GRACE
Tell me you’re joking.
Grace opens the hood of Jake’s link unit. Jake starts  hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to  help him but --
JAKE
Don’t! I got this.
Grace steps back, hands raised. He drags himself into the  unit.
GRACE
So you just figured you’d come out here
to the most hostile environment known to
man, with no training of any kind, and
see how it went? What was going through
your head?
He meets her eyes with a defiant glare.
JAKE
Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling
me what I couldn’t do.
Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the  link chair by hand.
 18.
Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit.  It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors,  then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL --
GRACE
Relax and let your mind go blank. That
shouldn’t be hard for you.
JAKE
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --
But the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest.
MAX
Initiate link.
The LINK TECH touches some controls.
ON A LARGE MONITOR a 3D SCAN of Jake’s brain appears.  Regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors.
MAX
That’s a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.

Go figure.
GRACE

(walking away)
Alright, I’m going in.
TECH
Phase-lock at forty percent. He’s in
transition.
Max watches a display showing the avatar’s nervous system  aligning with Jake’s -- two ghostly networks of light  merging.
MAX
That’s it. Find your way home.
ECU JAKE, inside the link unit. His eyes move under the  lids, like a dreamer in REM sleep as --
INSIDE JAKE’S MIND -- radiant streamers coalesce into a  pulsing TUNNEL OF LIGHT and --
THE SCREEN FLARES WHITE -- ZZZWHAP! -- resolving into an  overexposed, out-of-focus image -- two BLURRY FACES wearing  masks, looking down.
ECU JAKE’S AVATAR -- two very intense eyes FILL FRAME, the  pupils contracting. Golden irises pulse with life.

He’s in.
 19.
MAX
TECH

Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link
is stable.
Blinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney. He looks down  at his AVATAR BODY, touching his chest with one hand.
MAX
Take it slow, Jake. We need to check
your motor control. Try touching your
fingertips together --
But Jake isn’t listening. He’s staring at his legs. He  eases them off the gurney and --
HIS BLUE FEET touch the concrete floor, taking his weight.
JAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs. His  expression is child-like with wonder.
HIS POV -- looking down at the med techs, who seem the size  of children next to his 9’ tall frame.
He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm  and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL.
As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a  table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max.
MED TECH
Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down --
But Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest.
MAX
Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests --
But Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the  door and --
EXT. AVATAR COMPOUND - DAY
Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself  in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area.
Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front  of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about  their daily activities around the compound.
 20.
Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little  unsteadily, but his expression is joyful.
He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are  calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn’t hear them -- he’s  running. RUNNING!
He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid  neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling  his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling  in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He  looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world.
GRACE (O.S.)
Hey Marine!
Jake turns at the familiar voice to see --
A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach  and firm athlete’s breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt.  In human years she would be about 35.

Grace?
JAKE GRACE

Well who’d you expect, numbnuts? Think
fast!
She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches.
GRACE
Motor control is looking good.
Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin.
NORM (O.S.)
Hey, check it out.
Jake turns to see NORM’S AVATAR posing like a bodybuilder --  chest shot, back shot, bi’s.
NORM
I am a living god.CUT TO: EXT. MINE PIT - DAY
A WIDE SHOT of the terraced crater of the UNOBTANIUM MINE. A  quiet beat, then --
 21.
K-WHOOOOM! The entire face of one terrace is blown skyward  in a chain of EXPLOSIONS. The “shot” blasts hundreds of tons  of rock loose.
LONG LENS ANGLES of enormous WHEEL-LOADERS shovelling up ore rich rock and dropping it into DUMP TRUCKS. EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
A wall of steel FILLS FRAME. The DOZER BLADE crushes  everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling.
WIDER, showing the CLEAR-CUTTING operation near the mine, as  a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS three stories tall rip into the tree-line.
One of the dozers has rotating SLASH-CUTTER, a vicious  spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through  the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood-shrapnel.
The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL  QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing  breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
A BANSHEE -- a fearsome aerial predator -- HURTLES from  above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. We get a  glimpse of glassy fangs before --
P-P-POOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his  massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK.
It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed  rounds. The newbies stare at the thing’s barracuda teeth.
QUARITCH
For you pogues, this is a banshee. A
small one. See, they like it when I
bring fresh meat out here. And this
clearcutting really stirs up the hornet’s
nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If
it moves, shoot it. If you’re not sure
it’s moving -- shoot it! If it looks like
a bunch of flowers you want to take home
to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT!
What’re you gonna do?
TROOPERS
Shoot it, sir!
QUARITCH
Outstanding. Let’s roll.
 22.
Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his  eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an  AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush.
As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the  trail -- an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and  feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver’s web.
He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it  into the mud as he moves on.
INT. AVATAR LONGHOUSE - DUSK
Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical-style  construction -- beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen.
Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night,  pulling insect netting around their cots. In one hand, Jake  holds the end of his long braided QUEUE of hair.
CLOSE ON the queue -- the ends of the hair writhe slowly with  their own life, like tendrils of a sea creature.
JAKE
That’s kinda freaky.
GRACE switches off the overheads.
GRACE
Lights out amigos. See ya’ at dinner.
Jake sits in the twilight, listening to the SCREECHES and  HOOTS from the forest. Finally he lies down, CLOSING HIS  EYES and --
INT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT
ECU HUMAN JAKE -- his eyes OPEN.
Jake blinks, disoriented, as Max opens the upper clamshell of  his link unit.
In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her  neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette.
GRACE
(looking down)
Damn. Same old sack a’ bones.
JAKE struggles with the dead weight of his legs as he hauls  himself out of the unit. CUT TO
 23.
INT. COMMISSARY - EARLY MORNING
JAKE sits with GRACE, NORM and the other avatar “drivers”,  while around them miners, troopers and other base personnel  wolf their breakfasts. Grace is engaged in a heated  conversation with another SCIENTIST.
Jake, isolated from the conversations around him, notices --
PILOT TRUDY CHACON approaching, dressed in her flight suit.  She’s a rock-hard former Marine with thousands of flight  hours out in the badlands.
TRUDY
Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the
Armor Bay.
Jake gives Norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table.  He wheels away, led by Trudy.
TIGHT ON GRACE, scowling as she watches him go. CUT TO: INT. ARMOR BAY - MORNING
JAKE AND TRUDY enter the ARMOR BAY, passing TILT-ROTORS under  repair. There are the heavily armed SCORPIONS as well as  several SA-2 SAMSON work-horses outfitted with door guns and  rocket pods.
JAKE
You guys’re packing some heavy ordinance.
TRUDY
Yeah, ‘cause we’re not the only thing
flyin’ around out there. Or the biggest.
I’m gonna need you on a door gun, I’m a
man short.
JAKE
Yeah, no problem.
She extends her fist and he taps it with his.
TRUDY
See ya on the flight-line, zero nine.
(she points)
He’s down there.
Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor  Bay, passing rows of AMPSUITS standing in service racks.  Techs clamber over the ‘suits, loading ordinance with cranes  and lifts.
 24.
At the end of the row is a makeshift GYM area. QUARITCH is  bench-pressing massive plates.
QUARITCH
This low gravity makes you soft.
(pushing the last rep)
You get soft, Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.
Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded.
QUARITCH
I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela
-- that was some mean bush. Nothing like
this here, though. You got heart kid,
coming out here.
JAKE
I figured -- just another hellhole.
Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder.  The CHIEF MECHANIC yells from the nearest AMPSUIT --
MECHANIC
That servo’s in, Colonel, if you want to
try it.
Quaritch crosses to the ‘suit, with Jake following.
QUARITCH
I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
you. More than a few. Two tours in
Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here
and --
He points to his scarred face.
QUARITCH
They could fix this if I rotated back.
But you know what? I kinda like it.
Reminds me every day what’s out there.
Besides, I can’t leave --
He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree line.
QUARITCH
This is my war, here.
Quaritch climbs the ‘suit and reaches into the cockpit,  throwing some switches. The ‘suit’s gas-turbine spools up  with a rising WHINE.
 25.
QUARITCH
The avatar program is a joke -- buncha
limpdick scientists. But we have a
unique opportunity here, you and I. A
recon Marine in an avatar body could get
me the intel I need, on the ground, right
in the hostiles’ camp.
The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the ‘suit trembles with  power. The air boils above the exhaust vents.
Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one  huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic --
QUARITCH
Looks good.
(to Jake)
I need you to learn about these savages,
gain their trust. Find out how I can
force their cooperation, or hit ‘em hard
if they don’t. Maybe you can keep some
of my boys from going home like you. Or
bagged-and-tagged.
JAKE
(nodding)
That sounds real good, Colonel. So -- am
I still with Augustine?
QUARITCH
On paper. You walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one, but
you report to me. Can you do that for
me?
Jake nods. Quaritch brings the ‘suit to life. He steps  forward and pivots smoothly.
He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping  the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing  a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.  He’s impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind  of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.
QUARITCH
Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get
me what I need, I’ll see you get your
legs back when you rotate home. Your real
legs.
He raises the ‘suit’s hand, and slams the canopy shut like  the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge  feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG!
 26.
INT. BIO LAB - DAY
GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their  FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX.
GRACE
Start calibrating. We’re on the flight
line in ten minutes.
Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM  fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR.
GRACE
What did Atilla want?
JAKE
Just Marines comparin’ tattoos.
GRACE
(not buying it)
Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --
She stops, turning to drill him with a look.
GRACE
-- you’re driving an avatar, now. That
means you’re in my world, got it?

Got it.
JAKE

She turns and enters the LINK ROOM.
INT. LINK ROOM
Grace crosses to the controls of Jake’s LINK UNIT. As the  others catch up --
GRACE
That son of a bitch has screwed up this
program enough. All this --
(indicating link room)
-- exists so we can go out there and
build a bridge of trust to these people,
who could teach us so much. But thanks
to Quaritch and his thugs the Na’vi won’t
even talk to us anymore.
JAKE
Then how’s this supposed to work?
 27.
GRACE
We have a new face.
(turning to Norm)
You’re fluent, you’ve studied the
culture. You’re non-threatening. The
ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan --
may give you a chance. Maybe you can get
them back to the table before things go
tits-up for good.
NORM
This is failing as a pep talk.
Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link.
JAKE
How do we contact them?
GRACE
We don’t. They contact us. If they see
us taking our samples, treating the
forest with respect --
(pointedly to Jake)
Not trampling everything in sight --
they may reach out to us.
JAKE
Or they may skin us and make a drum.
Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body.
GRACE
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do
the talking.
She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we --CUT TO: EXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL - DAY
FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and  cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY’S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its  shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is  tiny in the vast primeval landscape.
ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper  WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun,  scanning for aerial predators.
In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest  unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes.  Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids.
 28.
TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a  shallow river.
TRUDY (INTERCOM)
Sturmbeest herd, one o’clock.
Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see-- A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures  reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river.
GRACE
Looks like a bull, six cows and some
juveniles.
NORM
The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
Grace nods approvingly.
TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight  from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water  above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS.
TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a  WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling  in on the gorge below like it’s a gun-run.
Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he’s about to puke.
WAINFLEET
Yo Chacon! Get some!
Jake grins into the airstream.CUT TO: EXT. CLEARING - DAY
A small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like “grass”  is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson  settles to the ground.
Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and  hefts it like an assault rifle.
He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree line warily, weapons aimed.
Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut  down. Trudy kills the Samson’s TURBINES.
Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back.
 29.
GRACE
Stay with the ship.
(for Jake)
One idiot with a gun’s enough.
WAINFLEET
Whatever you say, Doc.
Jake takes point as they enter the jungle.
WAINFLEET
(laughing)
Ya’ll have fun out there.
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
The forest engulfs JAKE, GRACE and NORM in cyan gloom. The  shadows are alive with the CHITTERING sounds of unseen alien  wildlife.
TRACKING WITH JAKE as he moves through the foliage, hyper alert -- looking around like a tourist in Hell.A monkey-like  PROLEMURIS leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing  through the sunlight streaming down in shafts.
A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he  passes.
This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that  react and move like animals. Jake white-knuckles his rifle  as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death.
GRACE
Relax, Marine. You’re making me nervous.
She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower  his muzzle as he follows her. Grace moves nimbly on the  path, seemingly unconcerned.CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST/ GLEN
WIDE SHOT as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as  ants. The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher. CUT TO:
EXT. SCHOOL RUINS - DAY
They enter a clearing with an OVERGROWN BUILDING made of  timbers cut from the local trees, with a thatch roof. It is  covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it.

NORM
How will they know we’re here?
GRACE
I’m sure they’re watching us right now.
Norm gulps. Jake looks behind him as they approach the  school, feeling unseen eyes.CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL RUINS
TRACKING WITH JAKE’S BOOTS as he steps among dried leaves and  a few moldering CHILDREN’S BOOKS. Floorboards CREAK.
GRACE (O.S.)
The kids were so bright, so eager to
learn... they picked up English faster
than I could teach it to them.
WIDER as Jake explores the room. Grace and Norm are selecting  INSTRUMENTS from storage cases on a wooden table.
GRACE
Bring the soil probe -- right there,
yellow case.
Jake looks up at a RUSTLING among the dark rafters. Roosting  STINGBATS eye him warily, fluttering their wings.
Grace picks up a moldering copy of “The Lorax” by Dr. Seuss  from the floor and puts it back on a shelf.
GRACE
(wistfully)
The stingbats knock them off. I guess I
always hope somebody will come back and
read them.
NORM
Why don’t they come back?
GRACE
(grimly)
The Na’vi learned as much about us as
they needed to know.
Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard -- reaches  out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate.  Unmistakably BULLET HOLES.
 31.
JAKE
(turning to her)
What happened here?
GRACE
(sharply)
Are you going to help with this gear?
We’ve got a lot to do.
She turns away. Jake watches her as he jams equipment into  his pack. CUT TO:
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
CLOSE ON Grace’s blue hand gently brushing away soil,  exposing a tangle of ROOT TENDRILS.
GRACE
See, right here where the roots of the
two trees interact.
WIDER -- GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal  roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needle-like probe.  Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots.
JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters.
He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulder-high SPIRAL PLANTS  called HELICORADIANS.
He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! -- it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in  the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish.
Curious, Jake touches another -- SHTOONK! And another --  like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK!  SHTOONK!
A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into  the ground, REVEALING --
A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but  twice that size. Its massive, low-slung head has projections  of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark.
Its baleful eyes lock onto him. Jake raises his rifle.
Grace, alerted by the creature’s SNORTS, runs to where she  can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE.
GRACE
Don’t shoot. You’ll piss it off.
 32.
The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide  sledgehammer of a skull.
JAKE
It’s already pissed off!
GRACE
Jake, that armor’s too thick. Trust me.
Jake starts to back away. The hammerhead bellows again,  pawing the earth.
GRACE
It’s a territorial threat display. Do not
run, or he’ll charge.
JAKE
What do I do?
GRACE
Hold your ground!
The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering  saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES --
Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide  and runs straight at the thing.
It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT.
ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked.
JAKE
Oh yeah! Who’s bad?! That’s right.
SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus --
A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has  ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the  Alien for desert.
It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored  head and massive distensible jaws.
JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the  hammerhead --
JAKE
That’s what I’m talkin’ about, bitch!
The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away  through splintering undergrowth.
 33.
JAKE
That’s right motherf--
A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see --
THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing  between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes.
The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the  hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face  Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS.
JAKE
What about this one? Run, don’t run?
What?
GRACE
Run. Definitely RUN!
Jake BOLTS as --
The thanator LEAPS after him and --
Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the  beast to claw its way around to the side while --
Jake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and --
SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off  a trunk as --
JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle  the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but --
JAKE dives under a massive root system, and --
CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the  root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he  rolls and crawls --
Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks,  sending chunks of wood flying. It’s spittle sprays across  Jake, jaws inches away as --
He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the  rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an  ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK  away. Jake scrambles to escape but --
GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and --
The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a  junkyard dog with a rabbit, only --
 34.
It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and --
He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its  teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but --
With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him,  splintering trees.
JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening  black tornado shreds the forest behind him and --
He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might --
The thanator’s jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies  out into open space and --
JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river.
The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to  rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon.
Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past  his face amid turbulent bubbles.
A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the  thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and --
Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract. EXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS - DAY
The water boils below the cataract. Jake’s head bursts  through the surface, and he gasps for breath.
He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a  limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just  lies there gasping on the trunk.
Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which  echoes across the jungle.CUT TO:
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
JAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant  leaves. He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with  his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip.
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
TRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it’s a  minefield, carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled. He is freaked  and hyper-alert.
 35.
The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the  sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the  cyan gloom.
POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake  move warily through the forest.
ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows.
DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to  him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA’VI  GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving.
She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders,  and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful --  for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her  name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).
Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious.
NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement  she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT  JAKE. Utterly silent.
Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his  THROAT.
ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing  for the shot --
-- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G. She  hesitates.
RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single  WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a  dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky  CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It  glows faintly in the dark shadows.
NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly. The  woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom.CUT TO:
INT./EXT. SAMSON - SUNSET
GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY  banks in a search pattern.
TRUDY (INTERCOM)
I’m going to have to call it, guys. We’re
not allowed to run night ops. Colonel’s
orders.
 36.
Grace looks to the west. The sun setting behind alien trees.

Shit.
GRACE TRUDY

Sorry, Doc. He’s just gonna have to hang
on ‘till morning.
GRACE
He’s not going to make it till morning.
Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard,  thundering away toward the setting sun.CUT TO:
EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
LONG LENS-- POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the  black trees.
Jake’s got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid  grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by  a pack of VIPERWOLVES.
Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking  black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.
TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake’s hands as he knots his T-shirt  around the butt end of the spear.
ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams  the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,  leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the  trail.
Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.  Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black  SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead. Another on  his opposite flank.
Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.  They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.
 37.
JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a  steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it  on a horizontal trunk --
-- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates  GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The  viperwolves have him encircled.
The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each  other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on  his legs from behind but --
JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face. It yips and goes  past, but ANOTHER moves in --
He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,  retreating, baring its fangs.
Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees  what he’s up against. The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with  shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.  Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
Jake realizes that he is making his final stand. He whirls  the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a  lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
JAKE
(screaming)
I don’t have all goddamn night! Come on!
Come on!
With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking  true, but --
Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes  flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in  pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
CUTS deep into the beast’s shoulder and it lets go.
JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf  leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake  tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --
 38.
THREE WOLVES charge at once. The nearest LEAPS at his throat  just as --
THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight. He pushes it  off in time to see --
A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw  and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another  wolf falls.
NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the  skull of a circling wolf.
ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but  rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,  but --
It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its  throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT  across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
NEYTIRI
Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past  them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--
They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--

Raaaarrrr!
NEYTIRI

Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his  weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it  and looks up at --
NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening  to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is  over, she turns.
She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.  Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
JAKE
Wait, don’t --
 39.
Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still  see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest  is transformed.
The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and  patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
Jake scrambles to recover his spear. Neytiri kneels beside --
A DYING WOLF. It’s CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,  trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its  chest.
NEYTIRI
(in Na’vi)
Forgive me, my brother.
She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches  its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her  waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling  the arrow from its heart.
JAKE
Look, um, I know you probably don’t
understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
you. I owe you.
Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead  animal.
NEYTIRI
(in Na’vi)
Forgive me. May your spirit run with the
Great Mother.
JAKE
I would have been screwed if you hadn’t
come along --
She rises and walks away without looking at Jake.
JAKE
Hey, wait. Wait! Where you goin’?
He crashes through some plants, catching up to her.
JAKE
Slow down a second will you. I just want
to thank you for killing those --
He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --
 40.
WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a  fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who  speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
NEYTIRI
Don’t thank! You don’t thank for this!
This is sad. Very sad, only.
JAKE
Okay, I’m sorry. Whatever I did -- I’m
sorry.
She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.
NEYTIRI
All this is your fault! They did not need
to die.
JAKE
They attacked me. How’m I the bad guy
here--
She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
NEYTIRI
Your fault! You are like a baby, making
noise, don’t know what to do. You should
not come here, all of you! You only come
and make problems. Only.
Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.
JAKE
Okay, fine, you love your little forest
friends. So why not just let them kill
my ass? What’s the thinking?
CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes  MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big  gold orbs.
NEYTIRI
Why save you?
JAKE
Yes, why save me?
NEYTIRI
You have a strong heart. No fear.
She leans closer --
 41.
NEYTIRI
But stupid! Ignorant like a child!
She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her. TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.
WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which  forms an elevated walkway.
Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far  above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move  through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.
JAKE
If I’m so ignorant, maybe you should
teach me.
NEYTIRI
Sky people can not learn. You do not
See.
She leaps to another elevated root. Jake follows, surprised  that he made it.

Whooaa.
JAKE

He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.
JAKE
Then teach me to “see.”
She stops and he almost runs into her.
NEYTIRI
No one can teach you to See.
Then she turns and trots on.
EXT. GORGE - NIGHT
They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a  horizontal trunk big as an oak.
WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers  silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred  feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other  night flyers.
JAKE
Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just
got off on the wrong foot and --
 42.
Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.
JAKE
--you just have to get to know me. I’m
Jake. Jake Sull--
A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance. He drops  the spear and almost falls off the root.
JAKE
Whooaaa -- shit!
Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He  watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.
She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na’vi.
JAKE
I need your help.
NEYTIRI
You should not be here.
JAKE
So take me with you.
NEYTIRI
No. You go back.
DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down  through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently  toward Jake and Neytiri.
NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards  Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.
JAKE
(off her amazed look)
What?
More woodsprites gather around him. Several ALIGHT on him.
Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow  he’s not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing  all over his arms, hands, body.
JAKE
What are they?
CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread.
 43.
NEYTIRI
Atokirina’. Seeds of the Great Tree --
very pure spirits.
Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT --  moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He  studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until --
-- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering  into the darkness.
JAKE
What was that all about?
Neytiri seems shaken. She seizes his hand and pulls him  after her.
NEYTIRI
Come!CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder.  He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence  shiver through them.
Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which  reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green  light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each  footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch  down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.
WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL. Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.
JAKE
What’s your name?
JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at  him, spinning end for end and --
SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs. He topples off the root  and crashes into the foliage below.
JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --
SEVERAL NA’VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding  DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales.
 44.
We see that the riders’ QUEUES are connected to the horses’  long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can  command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.
The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake  turns to bolt, but --
NA’VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed --  blocking his retreat.
Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the  LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na’vi --
NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
Tsu’tey, what are you doing?! He is my
captive!
TSU’TEY(tsu-Tay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted  features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings  off his mount with fluid grace.
TSU’TEY
(subtitled)
These demons are forbidden here. I will
kill this one as a lesson to the others!
Tsu’tey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake,  confronting him warrior to warrior.
NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
Stop! There has been a sign. This is a
matter for the Tsahik.
Tsu’tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with  her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts  his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS.
TSU’TEY
(subtitled)
Bring him.
They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears  and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu’tey  and the others ride ahead.CUT TO:
EXT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri’s village, which is  sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250  meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the  largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.
 45.
TSU’TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree,  shouting an ululating WARNING.
Jake is force-marched through the pillars into -- INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the  arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe --  mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to  outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow  him.
Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light  of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical  gallery -- a living cathedral.
Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with  fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous  creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.  Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --
EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply  chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS.  His normally stern features are clouded further by anger.
EYTUKAN
(subtitled)
Why do you bring this creature here?
Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na’vi.
NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
I was going to kill him, but there was a
sign from Eywa.
He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake.
EYTUKAN
(subtitled)
I have said no dreamwalker will come
here, to offend our home! His alien
smell fills my nose
Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not  submissive tone.
 46.
NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
Father, many atokirina came to this
alien.
JAKE
What’s going on?
NEYTIRI
My father is deciding whether to kill
you.
JAKE
Your father!?
(to Eytukan)
Uh, good to meet you, sir.
Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP  to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as --
A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber.
MO’AT
(Na’vi)
Step back!
Everybody looks up.
MO’AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down.  She is a severe woman in her 50’s. Her bearing is haughty,  her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is  elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH.
MO’AT
(subtitled)
I will look at this alien.
There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core  of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase.
NEYTIRI
That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one
who interprets the will of Eywa.
JAKE
Who’s Eywa?
Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo’at passes.
The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly  around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue.
 47.
MO’AT
(thick accent)
What are you called?
JAKE
Jake Sully.
She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a  flourish she strikes his chest.
Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some  between her fingertips. She tastes it.
MO'AT
Why did you come to us?
JAKE
I came to learn.
MO'AT
We have tried to teach other Sky People.
It is hard to fill a cup which is already
full.
JAKE
My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
Doctor Augustine. I’m no scientist.
MO'AT
What are you?
JAKE
I don’t know. I was a Marine -- uh, a
warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.
TSU’TEY
(subtitled)
A warrior! I could kill him easily!
EYTUKAN
(subtitled)
No! This is the first warrior
dreamwalker we have seen. We need to
learn more about him.
JAKE
What’s going on? What are they saying?
MO’AT
(to Neytiri, subtitled)
Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
speak and walk as we do.
 48.
NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry.
NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
Why me? That's not fair! I only--
MO’AT
(subtitled)
It is decided!
Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake.
MO'AT
(to Jake)
My daughter will teach you our ways.
Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if
your insanity can be cured.
She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern --
MO'AT
(subtitled)
He is your responsibility.
Neytiri nods, accepting, but she’s not a happy camper. She  grabs Jake’s arm and pulls him roughly away.
JAKE
So it’s all good, right? You and me --
NEYTIRI
Do not speak.CUT TO: INT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE
LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL.  He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound  with plant-fiber bandages.
THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They  stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the  circle.
JAKE
Don’t get up.
Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with  several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to  Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY.
JAKE
You never told me your name.
 49.
NEYTIRI
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at’ite.
JAKE
Okay, again, a whole lot slower.
NEYTIRI
(exaggerated slowness)
Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
Jake knows she’s baiting him. He smiles in response.
JAKE
Nay-TEE-ree. That’s nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu’tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together,  glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger.
TSU’TEY
(subtitled)
These aliens try to look like people, but
they can’t.
MO'AT
(subtitled)
He seems dim to me. And his eyes are too
small.
NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving  leaves onto his own leaf.
JAKE
Your mom likes me. I can tell.
MO’AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan.
MO'AT
(subtitled)
Neytiri will test this “warrior.” Hey may
learn nothing -- but we will learn much.
EYTUKAN
You speak truth. We must understand
these Sky People if we are to drive them
out.
Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing.
JAKE
These rock. What are they?
NEYTIRI
Teylu. You call beetle larvae.
 50.
Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a  CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and  starts munching enthusiastically.
JAKE
That’s some damn fine teylu. That’s like
grandma’s teylu.

The sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven  hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along  SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree’s outer shell.
Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness  around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl.  She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes.
Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads  through him. He closes his eyes and --CUT TO:

Unbelievable.
JAKE
It’s not something you can teach.
Some of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in  congratulation.
MAX
That’s awesome, Jake.
NORM chomps his bacon, fuming.

For reasons I cannot fathom, the
Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us

JAKE has reported to SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH. Quaritch turns  from gazing out at the wall of forest, displaying a feral  grin.
QUARITCH
Jarhead clan?
(he laughs)
And that worked?
JAKE
(grinning)
Yeah. They want to study me. See if I
can learn to be one of them.
QUARITCH
That’s how you seize the initiative. I
wish I had ten more like you.
SELFRIDGE
Look, Sully -- find out what these blue
monkeys want.

SELFRIDGE (cont'd)
We try to give them medicine and
education. Roads! But no -- they like
mud. I wouldn’t care except --
Selfridge turns to a large 3D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A  road runs from Hell’s Gate to a proposed new mine miles away.
SELFRIDGE
Their damn village is sitting right over
the richest unobtanium deposit for a
hundred klicks in any direction. Which
sucks -- for them -- because they need to
relocate.
JAKE
(taking that in)
Does Augustine know about this?
SELFRIDGE
Yeah, she does, and she’s on the next
ship back if she tries to cock-block me
on it.
JAKE
So -- who talks them into moving?
QUARITCH
(turning)
Guess.
JAKE
What if they won’t go?

(icy)
QUARITCH

I’m betting they will.
SELFRIDGE
Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
there’s one thing shareholders hate more
than bad press -- and that’s a bad
quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to
get them to move, or it’s going to have

NORM
Who’s Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The
Great Mother. The goddess made up of all

had any training whatsoever.
He hauls himself from wheelchair to Link.
JAKE
Who’s got a date with the chief’s
daughter?
GRACE
Knock it off. Jesus, it’s like
kindergarten around here.
As Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace  inputs commands at the control station.

Okay, let’s go -- village life starts
early.
MAX
Link is ready.
Grace lowers the bio-sensor array over Jake’s chest.
GRACE
Don’t do anything unusually stupid.
She closes the clamshell and we --
INT. HOMETREE/ THIRD LEVEL - DAY
CU JAKE’S AVATAR, blinking awake, staring up at --
HOMETREE, like a gothic cathedral overhead. Sunlight streams  down through gaps in the towering vault. CUT TO:
INT. COMMONS - DAY
JAKE walks among the villagers, who go about their daily  tasks.
-- young girls sit together, weaving and SINGING. They look  up as he passes, then go back to work.
--two men clean the fish they’ve caught.
-- a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an  infant.
--children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold  LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops -- staring -- then shrieks  with laughter as she runs back to her playmates.
GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a  DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed  MARE. His grin drops.
EXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE - DAY
JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds  its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts.
Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue.  He hesitantly touches them together and --
 55.
TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE.
Jake’s PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse’s  eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her  fingertips to the neural interface.
NEYTIRI
This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her
heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
legs.
Jake closes his eyes, nodding. One with the horse.
TSU’TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest  leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from  the edge of the pool. Tsu’tey watches Jake’s riding lesson  with disdain.
NEYTIRI
You may tell her what to do --
(she touches her head)
-- inside. For now, say where to go.

Forward.
JAKE

The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no  idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He  lands painfully in the mud.
He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads  the horse back to him.

Again.
NEYTIRI

SERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various  ways, seemingly landing harder each time.
ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully  rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees --
TSU’TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow  river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their  hooves.
Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu’tey stops his horse next  to him, looking down with disdain.
TSU’TEY
You should go away.
 56.
JAKE
(to Neytiri)
I knew this guy could speak English.
Tsu’tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back.
TSU’TEY
(subtitled)
This alien will learn nothing. A rock
Sees more.
She sighs in agreement. Tsu’tey and the other hunter wheel  their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods.
NEYTIRI gestures to Jake’s horse.
NEYTIRI
Again.CUT TO: OPS CENTER - NIGHT
Grouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE  and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through  plans he’s made of Hometree’s inner structure.
JAKE
You’ve got outer columns, then a
secondary ring here, and an inner ring.
Then a core structure, it’s like a
spiral, that’s how they move up and down.
QUARITCH
I’m going to need accurate scans of all
these columns.
JAKE
Roger that.
ANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. He’s been watching Jake  talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can’t hear him. Frowning,  he backs away, down the stairs.CUT TO:
INT. BIO LAB - DAY
JAKE, GRACE and NORM are packing science gear and supplies.
GRACE
I’m not about to let Quaritch and
Selfridge micro-manage this thing.
(she looks pointedly at Jake)
We’re going up into the mountains.
(MORE)
 57.
GRACE (cont'd)
There’s a mobile link up at Site 26 that  we can work out of.
NORM
The Hallelujah Mountains?
GRACE
That’s right.

Yesssss!
NORM

(off Jake’s look)
The legendary Floating Mountains of
Pandora? Heard of them?CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST - AERIAL - DAY
A SAMSON THUNDERS over the rainforest, climbing into the mist shrouded mountains.
In the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so  Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and  Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats.
Grace and Norm’s UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back  compartment.
TRUDY
It only takes tiny inputs. Here, put
your hand on the cyclic --
She points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly  reaches over and rests his hand on hers.
TRUDY
Feel how small the moves are? You barely
have to think it, and the aircraft
reacts.
ON NORM -- reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady-pilot. THE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK.
GRACE
See these magnetic formations. We’re
getting close.
TRUDY
Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.
On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out.
 58.
GRACE
Yup. We’re in the flux vortex.
AHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing --
THE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS. Right in front of them.
NORM
Oh. My. God.
Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out  the front canopy.
JAKE’S POV -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half  mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest,  and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them.  Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at  the bottom.
ON JAKE, staring in amazement. It is both awe-inspiring and  disturbing.
Trudy turns, grinning at Jake.
TRUDY
You should see your face.
WIDE AERIAL -- the Samson is tiny as it approaches the  floating islands of rock. An archipelago among the clouds,  they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below.
JAKE (V.O.)
Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace
explained it to me -- some kind of maglev
effect because unobtanium is a
superconductor, or something. At least
somebody understands it. Just not me.CUT TO: EXT. SITE 26 - DAY
A remote RESEARCH STATION -- TWO SHACKS and a few clusters of  instruments perched on a promontory near the Hallelujah  Mountains. The shacks are AIRLIFT MODULES the size of buses.
THE SAMSON LANDS, beating the grass with its rotor-wash. The  humans hop out, wearing MASKS.
They move toward the Shack, taking in the spectacular  panorama.CUT TO:
 59.
INT. SHACK - DAY
NORM and TRUDY assist JAKE with his chair as they cycle in  through the AIRLOCK. GRACE is already inside, starting the  GENNY. She turns on the lights and equipment.
There are 4 bunks, a clutter of science gear, and -- through  a short connecting corridor -- THREE LINK UNITS in the second  module.
As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at  STEREO STILL PICTURES which are taped and tacked up around  her workstation.
CLOSE ON PICTURES -- Grace posing at the school with various  grinning children. There is one of her with two lanky girls,  a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her.
GRACE
Jake, take number two, it’s the least
glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate
Jake’s link.
Norm glares at Jake as he passes.
JAKE
Hey. You got a problem?
Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over.
NORM
I trained three years for this mission.
I speak the language fluently.
(he points at Jake)
He falls off the frickin’ turnip truck
and all of a sudden he’s cultural
ambassador!?
GRACE
It’s not our choice, Norm.
He glowers at Jake.
NORM
Yeah, well I didn’t come out here to wash
the dishes while you’re on some
interspecies booty call.
He stalks off.
GRACE
He can’t go far.
 60.
She points to Jake’s link.
GRACE
Let’s get you in.CUT TO: INT./EXT. HOMETREE - BANSHEE EYRIE
LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the  ground. Villagers are ant-like.
Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core  trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out  of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --
A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see  other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like  enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of  STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES  clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the  shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest  banshees, this thing is taller than a Na’vi with a 10 meter  wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it  alights on the branch right in front of her.

Holy shit.
JAKE
NEYTIRI

Do not look in her eye.
Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and  gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the  shadows nearby answer.
Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the  Banshee’s ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the  neural connection is made.
NEYTIRI
Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
in the whole life.
She climbs smoothly onto the animal’s back.
 61.
NEYTIRI
To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must  choose your own ikran. And he must choose  you.

When?
JAKE
NEYTIRI

When you are ready.
The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.

Heeyaaahh!
NEYTIRI

Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee  DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest  canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a  power climb.
Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close  SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.
ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount,  the rainforest rolling beneath her.CUT TO:
INT. SHACK - NIGHT/EXT
STEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the  camera. He looks tired.
JAKE
Do I have to do this? I need some rack.
GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling.
GRACE
No -- now, when it’s fresh.
JAKE
Yeah, yeah.
(to camera)
The days are starting to blur together.
The language is a bitch, but I figure
it’s like field-stripping a weapon.
Repetition.
THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:
JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri  touches her lips with her fingertips.

Seyri.
 62.JAKE

She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.
JAKE
Ontu, mikyun, nari.
NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he  draws a longbow.
BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the  elbow, repositioning him roughly.
JAKE (V.O.)
Neytiri thinks I’m some kind of retard.
HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --
TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm’s bunk. Norm blushes  and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.
JAKE (V.O.)
Norm’s attitude has improved lately.
NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen.
NORM
Thank you?

Ireiyo.
JAKE

Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.
NORM
Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo. You’ve gotta roll
the R, r-r-r-oll it.
Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.
JAKE (V.O.)
It’s good he’s back on board, but he
thinks I’m a retard too.
TRACKING WITH JAKE’S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto  a thick root, running on across the rough bark.
JAKE (V.O.)
My feet are getting tougher. I can run
farther every day.
 63.
Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are  running 30 meters above the ground.
He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.  She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
JAKE (V.O.)
I have to trust my body to know what to
do. With Neytiri it’s learn fast or die.
Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --
She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows  its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and  catches another.
JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with  him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic  rush.
He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a  game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed. That he lived.
TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at  the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.
IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO’AT. The  Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.  Grace’s eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na’vi.
JAKE (V.O.)
I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and
Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes
me coffee before link every morning.
Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward  moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of  greeting.
GRACE
(Na’vi, subtitled)
I See you, Neytiri Mo’at’ite.
NEYTIRI
I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.
ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out  the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the  plants around her, and sniffs the air.
 64.
JAKE (V.O.)
I’m learning to read the trails, the
tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
scents and sounds.
JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --
A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows  of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are  sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes  flight, an explosion of purple wings.
Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her  ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are  closed. She speaks very softly to Jake --
NEYTIRI
When you hear nothing, you will hear
everything. When you see nothing, you
will See everything.
JAKE (V.O.)
Sometimes I have no idea what she’s
talking about.
Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male  HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri  watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a  beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.
JAKE (V.O.)
It’s been a month and I’m still not
allowed to make a kill. She says the
forest hasn’t given permission.
OMIITED
NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth. She points  and he parts some leaves to see --
A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk  around her legs. She licks their faces.
JAKE (V.O.)
There’s a lot of crap like that. She’s
always going on about the flow of energy--
the spirits of the animals and what not --
 65.
VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens. He’s  changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale.
JAKE
(smirking)
I just hope this treehugger shit isn’t on
the final.
Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.
GRACE
(without looking up)
This isn’t just about eye-hand
coordination out there. You need to
listen to what she says. Try to see the
forest through their eyes.
JAKE
Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,
okay?
NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by  galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move  gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night  forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing  from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom  of a pool.
A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow. ZAP!  Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting  his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are  GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
Aware of her touch, Jake’s focus is broken. Their eyes meet,  and she pulls away quickly.
NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.  Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature  on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING  perched on a frond. As he approaches --
SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a  bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening  like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.
 66.
Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An  EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until  they are all flying. And for the first time, she is  unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.
INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake’s eyes open in the darkness. He  doesn’t know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid,  blinking at the light.
JAKE (V.O.)
Everything is backwards now. Like out
there is the true world, and in here is
the dream.
TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes  focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies.
JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede.  He dispatches it with his knife.
He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na’vi.
JAKE
(Na’vi)
I See you Brother, and thank you. Your
spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays
behind to become part of the People.
NEYTIRI watches with approval.
NEYTIRI
A clean kill. You are ready.CUT TO: INT. SHACK - NIGHT
Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin. Norm  helps Grace get him to his chair.
GRACE
You’re still losing weight. Here --
She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien  food. Bites into it without enthusiasm.
JAKE
I made a kill today. We ate it. I know
where that meal came from.
 67.
GRACE
Other body. You need to take care of
this body.

Yeah yeah.
JAKE GRACE

Jake, I’m serious -- you look like crap.
You’re burning too hard.
Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out.
JAKE
Get rid of this shit, then you can
lecture me.
GRACE
I’m telling you, as your boss and someone
who might even consider being a friend
someday, to take some down time.
JAKE
Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee.
GRACE
Yeah -- you’re gonna go ride a banshee.
Or die trying.
JAKE
That’s right, Grace. This is what I’ve
been working for.
GRACE
And this is your check up from the neck
up, Marine. You’re getting in way too
deep. (she turns away)
Trust me, I learned the hard way.
Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace’s workstation.
JAKE
What did happen at the school?
GRACE looks up from making coffee. Her eyes track across the  pictures of the laughing children. Finally --
 68.
GRACE
Neytiri’s sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped
coming to school. She was angry about
the clear-cutting.
GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste.
GRACE
One day, she and a couple of other young
hunters came running in, all painted up --
they’d set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess
they thought I could protect them.
GRACE’S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible  story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator.
GRACE
The troopers pursued them to the
schoolhouse.
MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING.
GRACE
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.
Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the
others.
(mildly)
I got most of the kids out, before they
shot me.

Jesus.  Yeah.
JAKE GRACE

Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and  desperately trying to hide it.
GRACE
A scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten
years of my life into that school. They
called me sa’atenuk. Mother.
(turning to him)
That kind of pain reaches back through
the link.
GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake.
GRACE
It’s a job. Learn what you can -- but
don’t get attached.
 69.
GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes.
GRACE
It’s not our world, Jake. And we can’t
stop what’s coming. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY
TSU’TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two  TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who’s riding well enough to keep  up. The horses’ hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a  misty canyon.
JAKE (V.O.)
Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway
to heaven. It’s the test every young
hunter has to pass.
TSU’TEY signals a stop.
UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like  trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in  their gnarled grip.
A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the  twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural  occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the  clouds.
There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and  the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --
One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a  nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is  drifting toward them, filling half the sky.
The Hunters dismount.
JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He  turns to Tsu’tey, who is checking the young hunters’ gear.
JAKE
We doin’ this?
Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu’tey and the hunters swarm up  the base of the beanstalk.CUT TO:
 70.
EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY
200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along  the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium  BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of  a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs  over it -- it floats upward.
They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,  the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from  one of the waterfalls hits them.
Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper  branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.
One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.
Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling  over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands  above.
EXT. MONS VERITATIS - DAY
TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small  island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.
WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome --  the sheer side of Mons Veritatis.
Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of  sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.
EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY
A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the  gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below  -- a view from Olympus.
A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI’S  BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She  dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven  HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu’tey leads them  through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And  Jake sees --
The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls  with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.
 71.
TSU’TEY
Jakesully will go first.
Tsu’tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two  teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.
Tsu’tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.
NEYTIRI
(whispering)
Now you choose your ikran. This you must
feel -- inside. If he also chooses you,
move quick, like I showed. You will have
one chance.
JAKE
How will I know if he chooses me?
NEYTIRI
He will try to kill you.
JAKE
Outstanding.
Out of sight of Tsu’tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes  it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like  it didn’t happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK  and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing  rows of fangs, in a threat display.
Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.
A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares  straight at him.
Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it.
JAKE
Let’s dance.
The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as--
Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then  slipping aside as the banshee’s jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.
Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong  whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED  SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --
 72.
Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the  banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he  SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head.
Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his  queue but --
The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in  the face, almost knocking him out and --
IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the  rock and almost goes over the edge as --
NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu’tey laughs and yells mockingly.
The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way  pissed off now, but --
Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his  leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN  HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,  pinning it and --
Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams  the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --
The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting. They  are locked together, literally eye to eye.
JAKE
That’s right! You’re mine.
ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well.
Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over  the creature’s back.
Neytiri runs to him.
NEYTIRI
First flight seals the bond. You cannot
wait.
Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power. He grips  a hank of the beast’s main, and --
JAKE
Heeeyyyaaaah!
THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS  as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --
 73.
They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is  almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so  much he can't think.
JAKE
Shut the hell up!!
It does.
JAKE
Level out! Fly straight!
It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking “bank left”  and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy  loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.
NEYTIRI’S BANSHEE falls into formation with him. She signals  “follow me” and DIVES.
Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri’s  banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while  Jake’s wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.
THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE  around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning.  They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines.
Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the  cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge  into sunlight.
Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right,  then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal’s back.  He’s reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT.
Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy.  CUT TO:
INT./EXT. GROTTO/MONS VERITATIS - DAY
FLIGHT MONTAGE:
NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight  principles like one fighter pilot to another.
LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive  their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and  soaring into a series of aerobatic turns.
JAKE (V.O.)
I may not be much of a horse guy. But I
was born to do this.
 74.
THEY FLY in close formation with TSU’TEY and the young  HUNTERS, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist.
ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri  among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world.  She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He  DIVES after her.
IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE’S BANSHEE snaps at a piece  of meat which he playfully pulls back. He’s teaching it to  take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.
TSU’TEY is nearby with the young hunters. He eyes Jake with  frustrated hostility.
ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily.  She points and Jake sees --
A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form  rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the  caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and  ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.CUT TO:
EXT. RIDGE
JAKE flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge. She is  teaching him to hunt from his banshee. They carry their bows  at the ready, scanning below them for prey.
A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning. Jake  looks up to see --
A LEONOPTERYX in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him.
Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king  predator of the air: the GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Striped  scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head  -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snap-rolls and dives  toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as --
K-CRASH -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following  him down, both diving like missiles and --
JAKE yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between  two huge branches --
Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings.  It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its  mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy.
 75.
CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a  bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The  lord of its domain.
ON JAKE, shaken. Neytiri flies up, her expression the Na’vi  equivalent of Oh my God. A beat -- they both crack up.CUT TO:
INT. SHACK - NIGHT
Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation--  science graphics of the Leonopteryx. Trudy and Norm are  crowded around as well.
GRACE
The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial
predator. Not only rare, but the
sightings tend not to get reported.
Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb.
TRUDY
There usually isn’t time to key the mike.
JAKE
The People call it Toruk.
NORM
(translating)
Last Shadow.
JAKE
Last one you ever see.
TRUDY
I saw one take out a gunship once --
WHAM! Total frickin’ yard sale. Ate the
crew like peanuts.
TIME CUT -- Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops  her on one -- a 3D aerial shot of the strange arched  formation.

That’s it.
JAKE GRACE

Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls.
It’s their most sacred place.
She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the  Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior.
 76.
GRACE
Something big is going on in there,
biologically. I’d die to get samples, but
outsiders are strictly forbidden.
TIME CUT -- Jake looks through the pressure window at HUMAN  GRACE and NORM outside. Wearing masks, they are taking  readings from some time-series experiments Grace has set up.
As TRUDY watches, JAKE works fast to download Grace’s images  of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip.
TRUDY
They’re coming back.
Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates. Torn by what he is  doing.
TRUDY
If you don’t give him something, he’s
gonna shut us down.
He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her  flight-suit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock.
JAKE
Hey, guys.CUT TO: INT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
JAKE STARES up at the TOTEM SKULL, which we now recognize as  that of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX. NEYTIRI watches as he reaches  up to touch the tall indigo crest.
NEYTIRI
My grandfather’s grandfather was Toruk
Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk
chose him. It has only happened five
times since the time of the First Songs.
JAKE
That’s a long time.
Neytiri takes his hand, because that’s what the Na’vi do when  they’re telling you something important.
NEYTIRI
Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the
clans together in a time of great sorrow.
All Na’vi people know this story.
 77.
PUSH IN SLOWLY on the skull totem, then --CUT TO: EXT. RIVER BED - DAY
JAKE, NEYTIRI and other FLYING HUNTERS swoop low above a HERD  OF STURMBEEST -- a rapids of thundering muscle. Dust rises  from this living river like steam from a python's back.
TRACKING WITH the herd. A HUNTER appears in FG, astride a  direhorse at full gallop. The sight is breathtaking. He  hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest CRASHES down,  flipping twice from momentum.
JAKE ROLLS IN like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. He  draws and fires his bow. The arrow strikes true, in the  plexus between the armored shoulders and --
THE BEAST crashes to the ground. Skids to a stop in a cloud  of dust.
NEYTIRI swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning  wolfishly.
CU TSU’TEY, banking around Jake’s kill. Jake looks up, and  Tsu’tey SALUTES in grudging admiration.CUT TO:
INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
The central space is lit by a BONFIRE, around which the HUNT  FESTIVAL is in full swing. Wild dancing. People gnawing on  massive sturmbeest ribs. A bowl of some kava-like intoxicant  is passed around.
NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT.  NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail.
JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx  attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across  the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It  seems to watch Jake.
TSU’TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face.
Jake braces himself -- and Tsu’tey holds up the KAVA BOWL,  offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch?
Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters  hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm.
 78.
GRACE
Watch that stuff. It’ll knock you into
next week.
Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu’tey. They lock eyes.  Tsu’tey drinks.
LATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty  bowls near the fire.
WIDER ON JAKE and TSU’TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters.  Tsu’tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS.
TSU’TEY
I thought -- enough drink -- you would
not be so ugly.

Sorry.
JAKE

Tsu’tey looks deep into the fire.
TSU’TEY
Your warriors -- hide inside machines --
fight from far away.
(he looks at Jake)
I did not think a sky person could be
brave.
Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI’S lithe shape runs through  the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes  Jake by the hand and pulls him up --
NEYTIRI
You must dance! It is the way.
TSU’TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening --  the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger.
The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of  dancers.
Jake takes Grace’s hand and pulls her up, protesting.
JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets  himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal  energy.
GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so  repressed, who lives within her.
Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are  looking only at each other.
 79.
A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle  are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN  follow their look, seeing the obvious connection.
MO’AT
(subtitled)
We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is
with Tsu’tey.
ON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked  with Neytiri.CUT TO:
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
WIDE VISTA -- mist blowing through the treetops as the  morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast,  primeval land.
UP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down  like light in a cathedral.
JAKE (V.O.)
It’s hard to put in words the deep
connection the People have to the forest.
HIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri  gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping  nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly  sensuous image.
JAKE (V.O.)
They see a network of energy that flows
through all living things. They know that
all energy is only borrowed--
MACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops. A blue  hand picks the flower.
JAKE (V.O.)
-- and one day you have to give it back.
LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of  an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby  in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed  on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads.
Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places  a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body.
Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO --
